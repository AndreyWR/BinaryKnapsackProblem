# Binary Knapsack Problem

> Status: Developed

### Implementation of the binary knapsack problem using greedy approach

It is an application to measure the runtime efficiency of the greedy approach applied to the binary knapsack problem. 

## The algorithm was tested on files with different sizes (ammount of numbers) such as:

+ 10
+ 50
+ 100
+ 200
+ 300
+ 500
+ 750
+ 1000
+ 1250
+ 1500
+ 2000
+ 2500
+ 3000
+ 4000
+ 5000
